# Render Engine

It is a simple engine for rendering 3D objects on the CPU. At the moment it is under development. All classes in the engine are written using basic C# language features. No other libraries are used

## Start

*This engine only describes how to do math and calculate projections of three-dimensional objects on the screen*

Set a reference to the engine in your project and use the Render.cs class to get projections that will be displayed on the screen

### Requierments

To display the result you need some library capable of displaying graphical primitives on the screen
